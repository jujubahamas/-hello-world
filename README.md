# -hello-world

Hello Everyone, jujubahamas here. Directly from my living room in the Bahamas, trying to learn JavaScript
for the first time. And hopefully, on my way to learn Solidity in 2018. Intention is to be able to add some
logic to smart contracts using my intelligence.
Hello World is my first ever function. I'm very excited!!
